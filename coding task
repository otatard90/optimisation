AB Testing Coding Exercise

BACKGROUND
The iPlayer Editorial team have asked you to help them optimise the Homepage via an AB/multivariate test, namely testing the use of copy and imagery on the tiles. Their broad hypotheses are:
  1.	A more descriptive tile will drive more click through and ultimately, greater consumption
  2.	An image that uses close up photography of cast/characters is more attractive

 
Example tile

TASK
Please write some JavaScript that changes two or more of the above elements: image, category, brand title or episode title. This is an exercise in developing the variation(s), not the allocation or analytics. 

Please come prepared to talk us through the task and field any questions we have.

NOTES & CONSIDERATIONS
•	The iPlayer Homepage is highly dynamic and these tiles are unlikely to remain static over a period of time long enough to run an AB test.
•	Please ensure your solution works end-to-end and that you include instructions for us to run and test your code.
•	Your code should be available on GitHub or similar services, with a full commit history.
•	Although a fully working solution is desirable your response will primarily be evaluated against four key criteria:
  o	 Design, Modularisation and Componentisation
  o	Testing Approach and Scenarios
  o	Performance
  o	Style and Readability
